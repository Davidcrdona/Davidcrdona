- 👋 Hi, I’m @Davidcrdona
- 👀 I’m interested in financial modeling through the use of data science. Currently pursuing a postgrade in finance, trying to combine it with programming skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in python, and the use of database management with SQL, in order to take my knowledge a step further.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects. Moved for learning
